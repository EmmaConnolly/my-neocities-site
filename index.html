    <h1>Welcome to my Website!</h1>

    <p>My name is Emma Connolly, and I'm an entry-level software developer with a number of skills and interests. I'm planning to use this website to showcase my programming abilities and provide information about a few "side hustles" I'm going to run until I can get my software engineering career off the ground. It will start looking a lot fancier within the next few weeks!</p>
    <p>In the meantime, if you live in or near Arlington, Massachusetts and you are looking for a petsitter for your cat or other small mammal, you can email me at emconnolly72@gmail.com.</p>
